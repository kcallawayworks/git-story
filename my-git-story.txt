This will save my txt file and I now need to upload this corrected repository to Github

Creating a git repository
To tell git to start tracking the folder you’re currently in (don’t do this in your actualize directory!):

git init

NOTE: git init is only done once per project!

Saving versions with git
In your text editor, make changes and save the files.
In the terminal, enter git add --all
This adds your files to the Git “shopping cart”
In the terminal, enter git commit -m 'some descriptive message explaining the changes'
This saves all the added changes as a new version (“checkout shopping cart”)

Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3
Make changes
git add --all
git commit -m 'some descriptive message explaining the changes'

Miscellaneous commands
git status
See current status of git
git log
See list of commits
If the list goes past the end of the screen, enter q to quit
git log -p
